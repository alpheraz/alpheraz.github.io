						“Tim Brown is an important advocate for design thinking and the convergence of technology and design,” said Robert C. Pew III, Chair of the Steelcase Inc.

				I am a graphic designer and illustrator, I also design textiles, objects and spaces. I love the crazy culture clashes of Africa, and get lost in colors and patterns.
				I started working in Cape Town and London before co-founding Daddy Buy Me A Pony, which rose to be one of South Africa’s top independent design studios. During this time, we launched the award winning Afro magazine which gained a dedicated international following.
				In 2008, I moved to Brooklyn, New York. In addition to my commercial design work, I co-founded Mr Somebody Mr Nobody  that makes African inspired domestic curiosities.
				I created Extra Fancy as a platform to make and produce personal work and to explore creative arenas that I love.

				<p id="bodytext">The landscape of design is changing quickly and it’s time to rethink design education, together. As the field embraces an increasingly amorphous definition of practice and an ever-expanding toolset, educators have a unique opportunity to imagine the many possible futures of graphic design, and to speculate, dream, and ideate on the role of future graphic designers.
<br>
Future is a conference concerned with alternative models for learning, radical pedagogy, utopianism, emerging technology and tools, global economics and design, virtual classrooms, invisible worlds, the growing relationship between design and tech, homogeneity in design, imagined scenarios, the role of critique in a post-internet culture, and the speculative future of graphic design .</p>
